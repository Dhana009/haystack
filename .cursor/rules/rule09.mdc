RULE 9 – COLLECTION STRUCTURE & INDEXING

The Qdrant collection used by this project MUST:

have a fixed, agreed dimensionality for embeddings (matching the model)

have payload indexing configured for:

doc_id

category

status

repo

version

Any change to the embedding model or dimension requires:

either a new collection

or a full controlled reindex.
