## RULE 1 – QDRANT’S ROLE

**Qdrant is the semantic document store for this repo.**

It MUST be used only for:

- Long-form or medium-form text:
  - rules, standards, guidelines  
  - design docs, PRDs, specs  
  - architecture notes  
  - debugging summaries  
  - test strategies  
  - code explanation snippets  
- Versioned content that may evolve over time.

It MUST NOT be used for:

- Tiny atomic facts that are better represented as graph edges.  
- Per-token “chat logs” or ultra-fragmented memory.  
- Raw high-volume logs (they must be summarized first).

Qdrant = **“documents we want to retrieve semantically”**, nothing else.
