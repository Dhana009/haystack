RULE 7 – VERIFICATION & PLACEHOLDER PROTECTION

After writing, the assistant MUST:

Read back the stored document(s) by doc_id + version.

Compare the retrieved text with the intended content:

if content differs significantly → treat as failure.

Run placeholder detection:

if the document contains placeholder markers (e.g., "WRITE HERE", "TBD", "TODO"), and the original was non-placeholder, treat as corruption.

If verification fails:

mark the write as FAILED (no silent success)

log a diagnostic explanation

do NOT trust that document for RAG usage.
