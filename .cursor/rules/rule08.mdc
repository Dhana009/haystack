RULE 8 – BULK OPERATIONS

For large operations (e.g., populating all rules/commands):

Use batched write_documents with batch size limits (e.g., 64–256 docs per batch).

Before bulk insert:

optionally back up Qdrant or dump all metadata.

After bulk insert:

run a summary verification:

count of docs by category and status

sample hash checks.

Bulk operations must never silently ignore errors; partial failures must be reported.
